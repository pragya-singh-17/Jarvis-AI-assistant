Jarvis Response for prompt: using internet tell me what is Sun 
********************

The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system. Here's a summary of what it is:

*   **A Star:** The Sun is a massive, hot ball of plasma composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It generates light and heat through nuclear fusion in its core.
*   **Center of the Solar System:** All the planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects in our solar system orbit the Sun. Its gravity is what holds the solar system together.
*   **Source of Energy:** The Sun's energy is essential for life on Earth. It provides the light and heat that plants need for photosynthesis and that drives our climate.
*   **Size and Mass:** The Sun is huge. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 333,000 times Earth's mass.
*   **Age and Life Cycle:** The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is currently in the middle of its life cycle, known as the main sequence. It will eventually evolve into a red giant and then a white dwarf.
*   **Structure:** The Sun has several layers, including the core (where nuclear fusion occurs), the radiative zone, the convective zone, the photosphere (the visible surface), the chromosphere, and the corona (the outermost layer).
*   **Activity:** The Sun exhibits various types of activity, such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, which can affect space weather and have impacts on Earth.
